Simple wrapper around facebook-ios-sdk to allow posting to a Facebook feed from iOS5

To pull down run
git clone --recursive -b master git@github.com:stephenjames/FacebookHelper.git


See the sample project for setup /FacebookHelperSample.  Some notes:

1.  The FacebookHelper instance is access via the application delegate.  You need to setup an ivar.

2. You need to set your Facebook application id in AppDelegate.h and FacebookHelperSample-Info.plist.  You need to apply for a Facebook application id at https://developers.facebook.com/apps

3. To post a message call 
FacebookHelper *helper=[FacebookHelper helper];
[helper writeToFeed:message withDelegate:self];

which will respond via the delegate method below
-(void) didWriteToFacebookFeed:(FacebookHelper *)helper withFacebookUsername:(NSString *)username andProfilePicture:(UIImage *)profilePicture;
 

4. The sample project has the facebook-ios-sdk setup as a git submodule
